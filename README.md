# MalbecEcommerce 

Hello!! this is my Malbec project, is a Ecommerce focus on shoes. All made by Sebastian Velez

the project has 3 parts, the rest Api, the client side and the admin side

# Rest Api

the rest api was made entirely with express, token verification with JWT and the database in local mongoDB, all the rest Api
and the DB are on a Docker Container and in an amazon server, if you want to see it working on your device just download and 
install all the dependencies on your device! 


# Client react App

the client side was made all with react, redux Toolkit and stripe for payment method.
I use redux to mantain the user session and to save items in the shopping cart
the Visual part is Css and some styled components, the icons were add with material UI icons

if u want to see the app you can download and install the dependencies, or you can go to

# Admin react App

the admin side was also made with react and redux Toolkit, in the admin part the Admin User,
can see sales information, user list and product list, in addition to being able to create,
get, delete and update, the products, and the users.

all through a CRUD Redux application. 

if u want to see the app you can go to the admin link, of course you need a admin user to change everything
but if you want to watch you can log in with this user
