# MalbecEcommerce 

Hello!! this is my Malbec project, is a Ecommerce focus on shoes. All made by Sebastian Velez

the project has 3 parts, the rest Api, the client side and the admin side

# Rest Api

the rest api was made entirely with express, token verification with JWT and the database in local mongoDB, all the rest Api

install all the dependencies on your device!
